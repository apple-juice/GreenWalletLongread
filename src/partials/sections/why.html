            <p>The blockchain is an emerging technology that changes the way we trade and transact with each other. It establishes peer-to-peer trading. This means energy can be transferred from one person to another without relying on a mediator, which significantly reduces fees.</p>

            <p>Commercial and industrial facilities are investing significantly in local emergency backup infrastructures. A power outage at home is not nice. Even if it is only a temporary outage, it is necessary to set up the timers again, which is usually time-consuming. GEW provides a very efficient emergency backup system. One charged EV battery can power a household for up to two weeks.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The rapid growth of EVs and home solar systems offers great potential to facilitate the integration of renewable energy by using the EV and home battery as energy storage. GEW uses bidirectional power flows between the batteries and the power grid to stabilize the energy supply. Due to the high unpredictability of renewable power generation, this is of major importance.</p>

            <p>The trend is heading towards decentralized energy production. More and more homeowners are opting for their own solar energy system. To increase the benefit to their system, a home battery is required. Instead of feeding their overproduction to the power grid for a lower price, it is much more economical to store the energy for the household’s private use or give energy back to the grid and earn NRG tokens.</p>

              <b>Low-cost energy storage</b>
            </div>
            <p>The cost of stored energy is currently very high, mainly due to the capital investments necessary for the construction of energy storage facilities. Additionally, there are high maintenance costs. The advantage of GEW is that our batteries already exist. We have only to integrate them into the power grid. By using existing batteries as energy storage, there are no expensive installation and maintenance costs. Additionally, there is no need for  the installation of energy storage facilities with a negative impact on the environment.</p>

            <div class="about_item__title"><b>Important step to save our planet</b></div>
            <p>More than 80 percent of human-caused CO2 emissions come from burning fossil (coal, hydrocarbon gas liquids, natural gas, and oil) for energy use, mostly for transportation, heating and electricity. The intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that a CO2 concentration of 450 parts per million (ppm) would result in a global temperature rise of 2°C. At the moment the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is increasing by about 2 ppm annually with a current overall concentration of 405 ppm. Renewable energy is the world’s best chance to avoid catastrophic climate change.</p>
